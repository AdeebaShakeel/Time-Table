<p><h3>DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL</h3>1. The school’s approach towards discipline is for every student to acquire self discipline and be responsible conduct so as to contribute to the overall well-being of all in the school. Every child has the right to expect a conducive teaching and learning environment.
Likewise, every student has the responsibility to contribute to that environment.</p>

<p><H3>ATTENDANCE</H3>2. Attendance in school is compulsory. Absence from school must be supported by a medical certificate. Excuse from school may be granted on compassionate grounds and on a case-by-case basis. All medical certificates or letters of excuse must be submitted to the Form Teacher immediately when the student returns to school. Absence without valid reason will be deemed as truancy.
Parents need to apply for leave of absence for their child from the Vice-Principal to leave or absent themselves from school for urgent private matters. Permission to leave school early may be granted for special cases. The Form Teacher must be informed by the student and permission must be obtained from the Principal or Vice-Principal.
His/Her parent/ guardian will be contacted and his/her name will be entered in the Early Dismissal book in the General Office. Students may leave for overseas travel only during school-announced or official holidays.</p>

<p><H3>AFTER SCHOOL</H3>3. All students must leave the School grounds by 4.00pm. unless they are working in the
    School Library, in the Sixth Form Centre, in a classroom allocated for the purpose, or
    taking part in an organised School activity. Students who return from a School commitment
    after this time must ensure that their parents or guardians are informed and make
    arrangements to travel home as quickly as possible. Students taking the school bus at the
    end of the day must remain on site and in an appropriate area/activity as listed above.</p>

<p><h3>MOBILE DEVICES</h3>Mobile Devices
    The carrying of mobile phones is permitted at Whitgift School but they may only be used
    under tightly controlled conditions as set out in the Mobile Devices Acceptable Use Policy.
    Mobile phones should not be out on school premises unless permission is given by a
    member of staff e.g. to ring home or to record homework.
    Mobile phones are brought to Whitgift entirely at the owner’s risk. The School does not
    accept responsibility for mobile phones and parents or guardians should consider adding
    mobile phones to their house insurance in case of loss. It is also recommended that
    expensive phones should not be brought into school.
    Parents or guardians should be aware that the misuse of mobile phones will result in the
    confiscation of the phone for a period of time. Alternative arrangements should be made
    by parents or guardians to cover for such an eventuality. </p>

<p><h3>BULLING</h3>Bullying of any kind is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. Students must be aware that
    bullying is behaviour which is unwanted, unwarranted and causes distress. The following
    forms of behaviour are included in the definition of bullying:
    • physical assault
    • verbal abuse or aggression
    • deliberate exclusion from a peer group by rejection and isolation
    • aggressive or insulting gestures
    • extortion or coercion by means of intimidation
    The School will aim to provide prompt and appropriate action and support to persons
    involved. All members of the School community are encouraged to report any case of
    bullying to a member of staff. Any student who continues to bully cannot expect
    to remain a member of the School community. We recognise the importance of support
    for both perpetrators and victims of peer-on-peer abuse. Often perpetrators behave in this
    way because of serious pastoral issues of their own which need support. </p>

 <p><h3>DRESS & APPEARENCE</h3>Suitable dress and appearance are an essential prerequisite of membership of the School.
    Students are expected to be smartly turned out at all times with clothes and shoes
    clean and according with the uniform regulations.
    The rules regarding uniform at Whitgift have a very clear rationale, and that is that we are a
    community with a corporate identity. Students who look smart will have a positive self-image,
    and this will inevitably have an impact on their behaviour and the quality of their work. Staff
    and parents need to work together to achieve consistency with regards to the following
    regulations:
    • Hair – As a guideline, hair should be no shorter than a “grade 3”, but not long enough to
    draw attention. It also must be kept clean and tidy, off the collar, and may not be cut or
    dressed in any extreme or conspicuous fashion, including too short. Students should not
    use excessive amounts of hair gel, and must be clean-shaven. Dyed hair is not permitted.
    • Shoes – must be plain black, without buckles or conspicuous designer names.
    • School Bags – the School Shop sells three approved bags, with or without the School Crest.
    All students from the Lower First up to and including the Fifth Form must only use these
    bags.
    • School Pullover – students may only wear the regulation pullover, and no other. Hooded
    garments are not permitted.
    • Ties – to be worn at the correct length, with an appropriate sized knot.
    • Shirts – to be tucked in, sleeves down and top buttons done up.
    • Socks – dark colour (black/grey)
    • Sports Kit – only the approved kit, available from the School Shop, may be worn. Students
    must not leave the School under any circumstances wearing sports kit or CCF uniform, they
    must change back into their school uniform.
    • Jewellery – no jewellery or other ornaments may be worn. In the Sixth Form, students may
    choose to wear a ring, and a discrete, hidden chain or bracelet, in addition to a watch.
    Earrings are not permitted.
    • Jackets/Blazers – to be worn in corridors and in lessons unless permission is given
    otherwise.
    • Key Chains – must not be ostentatious.
    During hot weather ‘shirt sleeve order’ will be declared by the Senior Deputy. During this
    period students are not obliged to wear their jackets. Top buttons may be undone and shirt
    sleeves rolled up.
    Students must wear their uniform correctly, from their departure from home in the morning
    until their return home.
    In all matters of dress and appearance, the arbiter of what is acceptable is the
    Headmaster. A student whose dress or appearance is unsatisfactory may be sent home.</p>
